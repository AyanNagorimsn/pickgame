-- 2 Player Dice Game made from Javascript


<h2>Changes I Made 😁</h2>
I made this Mobile responsive because the code in the course is only focusing on javascript and their game is not responsive



<h2>How to play ❓</h2>
Goal of the game is to get 100 points <br>
You can roll a dice to increase current points.
Then, you can hold the current points to add in your score or take a risk to reroll the dice but If you get 1 You lose your current points and the opponent gets to roll.
<br><br>
I Made this two player javascript game while completing a course by <b>Jonas Schmedtmann</b>.
